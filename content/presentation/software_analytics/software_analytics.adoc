== Analyzing A Maven Repository

Rickard Öberg

This little nifty tool will allow you to import your local Maven repository information into a Neo4j graph, in particular dependencies between artifacts. 

You can then take this graph and put it into a Neo4j server,  and perform Cypher queries on it. 

Or whatever else awesome you want to do.

== JVM heap analysis using Neo4j

* Use Neo4J for ad-hoc analysis of heap use in a proprietary embedded JVM that's deployed in one of the most widely used consumer products in the UK (Sky Box). 
* Used Cypher queries that uncovered surprising aspects of their code, platform and the Java compiler. 
* **And finding a memory leaking JSON parser with a Cypher query.**

Looking for Smoking Guns in a Haystack - using a graph database for JVM heap analysis
experience report: 90 minutes
James Richardson
Nat Pryce
Late in the development of a major new feature for one of the most widely used consumer products in the UK we encountered potentially show-stopping memory fragmentation issues. Our platform uses a proprietary embedded JVM that has limited diagnostic tooling. We therefore had to build our own tools under intense time pressure. We used an open source graph database (Neo4J) and its query language to rapidly build an ad-hoc analysis tool, and successfully used it to track down and eliminate the problematic code from our product. We will discuss some of the challenges we faced using Neo4J for interactive analysis of quite large data imports (80K nodes, 150k relationships) and how we overcame them. We will then demonstrate (with live-coding) some queries to show the audience surprising aspects of our code, platform and Oracle's Java compiler. 

Many aspects of software can be modelled as graphs. Our experience shows that graph databases are a powerful foundation upon which to build software development tools. Thanks to increasing commoditization, we believe graph databases hold a lot of promise for non-mainstream programming platforms that are usually underserved by tool vendors.

== Software Analytics & Evolution

Analytics of (legacy) Software Systems

for modernization, insight gathering, testing, architecture retrieval

* Domain Knowledge Extraction
// Understand the meaning of your source code. Extraction of domain knowledge from source code as mathematical formulas, figures, decision tables or state charts. Automated redocumentation of complex technical software.
* Software Architecture Analysis
// Define reference software architectures and continuously check your architecture compliance. Manage, preserve, and share the knowledge that comes along with architectural decisions.
* Query Software Systems
//Use a central, graph-based repository to effectively query your own software system. Implement custom queries to identify interesting dependencies within your source code.
* Knowledge Driven Testing
// Make use of logic models to automate the generation of test cases for your software system (model-based testing). Extract knowledge from software repositories to focus your quality assurance effort.
* Measure Software Systems
//Software metrics allow the measuring of large scale software systems. Identify error prone parts within your software system or simply identify complex parts in your software that will be hard to maintain in the future.
* Domain Specific Programming
// Design of domain specific languages (DSL) to automate the generation of source code from extracted domain models. End user programming of complex technical systems.

== Using graphs for source code analysis

http://urma.com[Raoul-Gabriel Urma] (PhD in Computer Science, The University of Cambridge)  

Did you know that the source code of software that you engineer every day can also be represented as graphs?  

In this talk, we demonstrate how you can perform program analysis using Neo4j.  

We describe a prototype that stores a graph representation of the source code of Java programs in Neo4j. 
We can then query the graph using Cypher and we'll show various examples of possible queries such as “find me all recursive methods” and “find me all subtypes of a given type”.  

This talk is based on Raoul-Gabriel's  research paper 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/pk-urma-mycroft-scp.pdf['Source-Code Queries with Graph Databases—with Application to Programming Language Usage and Evolution']

== Source Control, Issues, Social Coding

* What can you learn from commits
* about the code
 * Class Toxicity, Frequency of Change (Feathers)
* about the people
 * checkin times, collaboration, commit-size, commit-frequency
* Issues
 * bug-rich classes (separation of concerns?)

== Example: Import Git Commit Logs into Neo4j

* +git log --format+ emits CSV
* Graph Model
* LOAD CSV with Cypher
* Create / Update complex Graph Structure
