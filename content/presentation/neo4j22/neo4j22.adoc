== Authentication / Security

* In 2.2 Neo4j server requires authentication
* Both for UI and Http-Clients
* Username + Password
* Single User so far
* API for updating credentials

[.middle]
== Neo4j Browser Update

* Query Template forms for Create and Query
* The Movie Graph

== Neo4j Browser Update: Styling

* New Visualization / Styling
** Auto-Caption
** Choose caption for rels
** Curved Relationship
** Panning
** Counts on Labels and Rel-Types

== Neo4j Browser UI

image::browser1.png[]

== Neo4j Browser Updates (2)

* Killing Queries
* :help keys, :help commands
* Input History `:history`
* Style `:style`
* Configuration `:config`
** maxNeighbours, maxRows, maxNodes

== Noe4j Browser UI (2)

== Neo4j Browser Update

DEMO with Neo4j - 2.2.0-RC01

== Neo4j Kernel & Performance Improvements

== Technical Debt, Internal Improvements

* Many internal changes
* Rewrite of larger parts of the kernel
* Not completely finished
* Deleted 30k LOC
* Easier to understand and maintain

== Concurrent Read Performance: Page Cache

* Don't trust the OS kernel ->
* No more memory mapping, 
* New page cache - optimal strategy
* Auto-configured, Off-heap

== Concurrent Read Performance: Page Cache

* Less contention, more time doing useful things
* Scales more linearly with cores
* Not dependent on kernel to write out dirty pages

== Transaction Performance

* Removed JTA and internal 2PC
* Internal clean-up and restructuring
* Unified log for graph and indexes (less to do)

== Batched Writes

* Costs for flush to disk for many concurrent transactions amortised +
-> especially useful for small transactions
* Pending Transactions are flushed with current sync operation
* Expecially helpful with remote Cypher execution

== Demo: Batched Writes: Java

=== Execute Java-API multithreaded to create 100M nodes and rels

----
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=perftest.CreateNodes
24 Threads on a SSD 
100 000 000 Nodes and Rels 160 599 ms = 1,25M entities / second
----

== Demo: Batched Writes: Cypher-Remote

=== Apache Bench w/ concurrent statements
----
ab -k -c 4 -n 100000 -p create.json -T application/json -H accept:application/json \
   http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit

3 nodes, 2 relationships per request

Concurrency Level:      4
Time taken for tests:   53.565 seconds (2.1.7)
Time taken for tests:   9.521 seconds  (2.2.0-RC01)
----

== Batched Writes (HDD)

== Batched Writes (HDD Small)

== Batched Writes (SDD)

== Cypher Performance

* Cost-based optimiser available
* Compliments existing rule-based optimiser
* Database Statistics are gathered and queries planned using those
* Allows for more informed planning

== Cypher Profiling
* Examine your execution plans by prefixing your query with `EXPLAIN` or `PROFILE`
* `EXPLAIN`: see the execution plan, but do not run it
* `PROFILE`: run the statement and track flow through, and IO for, each operator 

== Numbers

image::cypher_cost.jpg[]

== Demo

* 3 example datasets (some from GDB book)
* Results from Performance tests
** recommendations, social-network, access control
* 2 planners: PLANNER [COST|RULE] [PROFILE|EXPLAIN] statement
* use neo4j-shell to execute

== Interesting

* Cypher uses `getDegree()`
** In Pattern-Expressions like +`size((n)-[:FOO]->())`+ and +`MATCH (n)-[:FOO]->() RETURN count(*)`+
** In Patterns like +`WHERE [not] (n1)-[:FOO]->(n2)`+ (with n1, n2 known) (ExpandInto)

* COST planner disabled by default for Var-Length-Paths
** It's often better but sometimes worse

* Having more labels helps the COST planner to make better decisions

== Demo in Browser

* Visual Query Plan representation
* EXPLAIN shows estimated rows
* PROFILE shows rows and dbhits
* Details per Operator, Expand All
* http://neo4j.com/docs/milestone/execution-plans.html[Query Plans in Manual]

== Query Plan Viz

image::browser_query_plan.png[]

== Import

* Superfast batch loader now integrated as neo4j-import
* Initial Loading
* 1M records/sec - sustained!

== Numbers

image::import_tool.jpg[]

== Import Tool

* Importing initial data sets
* Parallel & Staged Architecture
* New CSV Parser with pre-reading Thread
* Concurrent creation of nodes, rels, properties
* Special Trick for updating relationship-list
* Low memory requirements

== Import Tool: Capabilities

* Link nodes via ID's
** actual, string, long
* Separate ID-Spaces
* property type conversion
* labels, rel-types in CSV and command line
* split CSV files (sep. headers)

== Demo: Importing Crime Data

Crime Stats in London 4M nodes 2x4M rels

[.normal]
----
./neo/bin/neo4j-import --into crimes.db --nodes primaryTypes.csv --nodes beats.csv \
--nodes crimes.csv --relationships crimesPrimaryTypes.csv ....

Nodes                           Done in 8s 866ms
Calculate dense nodes           Done in 3s 747ms
Relationships                   Done in 4s 627ms
Node --> Relationship           Done in 303ms
Relationship --> Relationship   Done in 1s 621ms
Node counts                     Done in 232ms
Relationship counts             Done in 1s 653ms
IMPORT DONE in 21s 799ms
----

== Conclusion: Neo4j 2.2 is

* faster
** Initial import at 1M records / sec
** Up to 10x faster Cypher queries 
** Up to 100x faster concurrent writes 
* safer
* easier to use
