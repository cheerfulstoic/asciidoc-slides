== Setup

For my [OSCON Programmers Blog] I decided to go with a conference data model. 
It consists of conferences, venues, tracks, sessions, attendees, tags and relationships like +RATED+, +PRESENTED+, +AT_CONFERENCE+. See the picture for details.

Setting up some data with it, we can run simple queries on the data model.

== Like this one

//setup
//hide
[source,cypher]
----
create (oscon:Conference {name:"OSCON"})-[:AT_VENUE]->(:Venue {name:"Portland Conference Center"}),
       (michael:Person {name:"Michael"}),
       (allison:Person {name:"Allison"}),
       (tutorial:Session {name:"Neo4j-Tutorial"})-[:IN_TRACK]->(:Track {name:"Tutorials"})-[:AT_CONFERENCE]->(oscon),
       (tutorial)-[:TAGGED]->(:Tag {tag:"Database"}),

(michael)-[:PRESENTED]->(tutorial),
(allison)-[:ATTENDED]->(tutorial)
----

//graph

Now we can answer some questions, e.g. 


== Tagged Sessions and their Tracks

Show all sessions that are related to _Databases_ and in which Tracks they are

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (track:Track)<-[:IN_TRACK]-(session)-[:TAGGED]->(t:Tag)
WHERE t.tag = "Database"
RETURN session.name as session, track.name as track
----

== Who are the presenters and their sessions

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (session)<-[:PRESENTED]-(p:Person)
RETURN p.name as presenter, session.name
----

== Who attends the conference

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Conference)<-[:AT_CONFERENCE]-()<-[:IN_TRACK]-(session)<-[:ATTENDED|PRESENTED]-(p:Person)
WHERE c.name = "OSCON"
RETURN distinct p
