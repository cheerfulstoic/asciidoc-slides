== Neo4j is a Graph Database

== Why Neo4j?

* Expressive and natural data modeling
* Easy and powerful query language (http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/[Cypher])
* Fast and easy querying on complex data relationships
* ACID / Replication

== Neo4j Crash Course

* Nodes and Relationships
* Both are key->value stores
* Nodes can have zero or more labels (User, Post, etc...)
* Relationships have a type (i.e. wrote_post)

== Neo4j Crash Course

* Relationships go from one node to another (directional)
* Querying can be directional or direction agnostic

== Cypher

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (user:User)<-[rel:written_by]-(post:Post)
  WHERE user.id = 123
  RETURN rel.location, post
----

* Return post and location it was made
* Location stored on the relationship

+++ <!-- ASCII art --> +++

== Cypher

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)<-[:written_by]-(:Post)<-[:comments_on]-(c:Comment)-[:written_by]->(u2:User)
  WHERE u.id = 123
  RETURN u2.name, count(c)
----

* Returns users who commented on posts by user #123
* Gives count of the number of comments for each users

+++ <!-- Automatic aggregation on columns when using an aggregate function.  Could also do RETURN p, u2, count(c) to get posts and a count of users for those posts.  Pause for questions --> +++

== Neo4j Resources

 * http://graphdatabases.com O'Reilly's Graph Databases (free and a great intro to the internals of Neo4j)
 * http://neo4j.com/developer/ruby/ Neo4j.com Ruby guides

== Neo4j.rb gem

[source,ruby]
----

class Post
  has_one :out, :author, type: :written_by, model_class: 'User'
  has_many :in, :comments, type: :comments_on
end

class Comment
  has_one :out, :author, type: :written_by, model_class: 'User'
end

class User
  has_many :in, :posts, origin: :author
end

user.posts.comments(:c).author(:u2).pluck('u2.name, count(c)')

# Compare to:
# MATCH (u:User)<-[:written_by]-(:Post)<-[:comments_on]-(c:Comment)-[:written_by]->(u2:User)
#   WHERE u.id = 123
#   RETURN u2.name, count(c)
