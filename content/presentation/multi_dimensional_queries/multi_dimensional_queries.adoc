== How do databases JOIN data?

[options=step]
* primary-key < -- > foreign key relationships
* have to find / lookup matching keys
* across indexes and tables / collections
* for each join during each query
* computationally expensive
* depend on data volume and number of joins
* Is there another way ?

== Cheap trick: prematerialize relationships

[options=step]
* store relationship-struct-list with node
* called ajacency-list
* direct pointer to relationship and other node
* no JOIN required, just following pointers

== "Join"-Complexity

* One Relationship: O(1)
* N Relationships O(n)
* All N Relationships across M steps O(N^M)
* Relationship-Counts O(1) also by type and direction

== Local Neighborhood Queries

[options=step]
* traverse 1..n steps out, 
* collect, filter and project information
* not affected by total data volume, just neighbourhood size
* full neighbourhood size n-levels out grows exponetially though!
* there are special approaches

== Special Query Use Cases - Graph Algorithms

[options=step]
* Shortest-Path algorithm
* Find connection between two known nodes
* Bidirectional implementation
* Routing: Dijkstra, A*

== Data Modeling: Dimensions

[options=step]
* arbitrary values -> properies
* boolean, small sets -> labels
* lists -> properties or linked lists
* order -> linked list
* hierarchies -> trees
* geo -> 2-dim r-tree
* facets -> n-dimensional tree

== Utilizing Structure

[options=step]
* Graphs are also access structures
* Use graph structures to provide alternative access paths
* Fast traversals / access to subgraphs
* Nodes and subgraphs are datapoints embedded in link structures
* Called: _in graph indexes_

== In Graph Indexes

[options=step]
* (Linked) lists
* Trees
* Multidimensional-trees
* Skip-list
* Streams (Activity-Streams)
* Hypergraph

== Linked List: Event-List

* one-dimensional
* Linked List of Data Points
* Optionally Double Linked
* Optionally Skip-List
* Represent Order, Sequence
* Multiple Linked Lists with individual relationship-types

== Tree: Time Tree

image::img/timetree.png[700,700,float="right",align="middle"]
image::img/ga_time_tree.jpg[700,700,float="left",align="middle"]

== Tree: Time Tree

* two-dimensional: width and height
* split time by unit: root<-year<-month <-day<-hour<-minute, ...
* granularity as needed
* create tree to root
* optional _NEXT_ links per level
* attach datapoints to appropriate level

== Tree: Bill of Material

image::img/bom_furniture.png[300,500,float="right",align="top"]

* everything can be deconstructed from a root
* broken into components, modules, parts
* machine, vehicle, factory, furniture
* combine structural tree with construction process tree
* store quanities, prices, volumes at lowest levels
* compute or aggregate on higher levels

== 2-dimensional Tree: R-Tree

image::img/spatial_rtree.svg[300,500,float="right",align="top"]

* three dimensions: height, width, depth
* project surfaces points and polygons into a hierarchy
* fast search for containment
* retrace and filter for concrete outline
* e.g. Neo4j-Spatial

== Multi-Dimensional-Tree: Facets

image::img/facetted_search_tree.png[300,500,float="right",align="top"]

* many (variably structures) dimensions of datapoints
* allow users to explore a dataset by also returning selected dimensinons
** good use of cypher collect() function
* combine several aspects in one big tree
* allows to aggregate over each or any dimension-group


== Neo4j APIs

[options=step]
* Cypher query language
* Neo4j-Server HTTP-APIs
** Cypher Endpoint 
** Graph Algorithms
* Server Extensions
** exposing HTTP Endpoints
** using Java Core API, or Kernel SPI

== Cypher: Neo4j's Graph Query Language

[options=step]
* Made for Graphs & Humans
* All about patterns
* First class graph concepts
* Derived from SparQL and SQL
* Declarative & Expressive
* Optimized for reading & understanding
* First class collection support
* Query, update, metadata

== SQL vs. Cypher

* Query Planner: 
** current - rule based
** next - cost based
* Runtime: 
** current - Scala
** next - Java/dynamically compiled

== How to create multiple dimensions: Java-API

* Create Tree's top-down link to datapoints
* Create Lists by forward or backward linkin
* recursive method calls for hierachies
* keep nodes in maps for quick lookup during structure creation
* map object structures to the graph -> static hierarchies
* Use a library, e.g. http://graphaware.com/neo4j/2014/08/20/graphaware-neo4j-timetree.html[GraphAware Time Tree]
